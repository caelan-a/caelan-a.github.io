                    <p><a href="https://robaws.be/"><b>ROBAWS</b></a> is a company based in Belgium that offers
                        “Administration software for construction and project
                        companies.”</p>

                    <br />
                    <h1>Project</h1>

                    <p>
                        Beginning in 2019, ROBAWS hired me to help construct a cross platform mobile app called Wappy to
                        power
                        their administrative software suite.<br /> <br />
                        The goal of this app was to allow project based companies such as those in construction to
                        consolidate
                        both delivery of work orders to employees, tracking of work done and materials used.
                        This would allow companies to maximise their efficiency and productivity while simultaneously
                        letting workers complete
                        their job and log required information reliably and conveniently.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Workers were enabled to log what materials they used, how much time they spent at sites etc.
                        More importantly they were given a streamlined interface to receive workorders from their
                        employers that
                        enclosed all of the contact info, locations, documents and associated data to complete their
                        work.

                    <img src="../images/projects/wappy/ss_2.svg" style="float: right;  max-width: 20em; margin-left: 5em; margin-top: 3em;">

                    <h1>Implementation</h1>
                    <p>
                        I started development working with direction from ROBAWS CEO Michaël Van Robaeys
                        who is a seasoned software engineer himself.

                        <br />
                        <br />

                        There were many design considerations from both a UI and backend perspective.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        With respect to the UI, first and foremost was the requirement of multiple languages given the
                        wide
                        geography of the app’s audience. This was supported by adding internationalisation (I18n) and
                        localisation (l10n) using the Flutter framework. As of writing this there are a multitude of
                        European
                        languages that are now supported.
                        Secondly, given the wide array of functions this app supports, a series of decisions to make the
                        UI
                        clean looking and easy to navigate were made. This included the TabView and flat design of tiles
                        and
                        buttons.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        The backend needed to be robust and easily extensible as it required on-device storage of user
                        generated content as well as the ability to sync and update with a remote server to fetch new
                        content from employers
                        and update existing info. A service pattern approach was implemented along with a local SQL
                        database
                        (SQLFlite) and gateway for API calls.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Many additional special features were implemented including start and stop timers, digital
                        signatures, remote
                        database tree navigation.

                    <p>
                        The app has a presence on both the Apple Store and Google Play. Being a centerpiece of ROBAWS
                        software
                        package, it is used by numerous companies and thousands of employees.

                        Development continues to this day in both maintenance and feature addition.
