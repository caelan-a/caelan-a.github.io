                    <h1>Project</h1>

                    <p>
                        Beginning in 2018, The University of Melbourne on behalf of the BuddyUp team commissioned me to
                        construct a platform that would allow students to form study groups based on shared subjects
                        with others they may not even know.
                        <br /><br />
                        The goal was to have a platform so streamlined and easy that students would jump on, have their
                        subjects and timetable already available and be in a group within hours.

                        <br /><br />The project scope included:<br />
                        • Realtime Firebase database to host account, message, and content data <br />
                        • Google App Engine instance to serve as an API that would run an algorithm to match students
                        together into appropriate groups<br />
                        • Cross platform Flutter app for users to engage on the platform <br />

                    <h1>Implementation</h1>
                    <p>
                        An important first step was designing the data model for this project as there were many moving
                        parts.
                        <br /><br />
                        One of the most crucial parts of the app was automatic retrieval of timetable and subject
                        information. Due to limitations from the University, a scraper was constructed for the
                        prototype, this was heavily involved as it needed to be robust enough to handle any errors that
                        may arise.
                        <br /><br />
                        The next step was to build the software that would analyse the Firebase database to match
                        students who both shared a subject and wanted to form a study group. This was done using python
                        on a GAE that is connected to the Firebase database.
                        <br /><br />
                        The app was then designed, prototyped and built in accordance with the features described below
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The app itself supported a number of features that cover a wide range of functionality
                        including: <br />
                        • Automatic retrieval of timetable and subject information<br />
                        • Friend and chat system both group and individual for students to connect and
                        organise<br />
                        • Interactive timetable to customise available times for study group<br />
                        • Inbuilt notification and day tracking to alert users when their study group was
                        meeting<br />
                        • Rating system to let the platform know who they liked meeting with<br />
                        • Connectivity with university library sensor API which returned library traffic <br />

                    <p>
                        Releasing the app was very exciting. In the first few days we had hundreds of users signing
                        up and creating new groups! It was both challenging and rewarding to monitor and maintain
                        performance using analytics tools like Sentry and Googles inbuilt Firestore Analytics.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The app was enjoyed for months before the COVID-19 pandemic arose and cause students not to be
                        able to meet up in person. The app was subsequently disabled until further notice.
