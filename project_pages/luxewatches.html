                    <h1>Project</h1>


                    <p>
                        Beginning in 2019, Luxe Watches hired me to design and build an instore app that would allow
                        staff to conduct transactions digitally that were previously done through pen and paper. This
                        was to allow transactions to be submitted along with details and images to their backend,
                        allowing business to be much more efficient and reliable.
                        <br /><br />

                        This app handled a range of different transaction types requiring differing forms while at the
                        same time providing a clean and quick interface that allowed transactions to be completed and
                        submitted to their database quickly. It was designed to function with their existing wordpress
                        backend.
                        <br />
                        <br />

                        Later on, the app was updated to allow remote signature signing which required development on
                        Wordpress and a standalone React web app that facilitated both desktop and mobile access. It was
                        also extended to allow comprehensive viewing and retrieval of submissions in the wordpress
                        database.

                    <h1>Implementation</h1>
                    <p>
                        The UI was designed in figma before being approved by the team at Luxe Watches. Tailored
                        graphics were created in Illustrator for use in the project. Subsequently, the app was built
                        using Flutter to support a number of iPads used in store.

                        A custom Wordpress plugin in PHP was developed to expose secure endpoints to the app which would
                        allow it to not only make submissions to the relevant database but also request the execution of
                        complex SQL queries such as searches that involved a number of parameters from the app user. It
                        also supported text field autocompletion within the app’s input forms.

                        To facilitate the remote digital signature functionality, the wordpress plugin was extended to
                        support automatic emailing to customers with a generated link to a React webapp that handled
                        that user’s specific signature submission with respect to a transaction.
